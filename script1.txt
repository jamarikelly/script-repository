# Objective: Demonstrate your ability to create a software management script. 
# Create a Bash script that will automatically update the server weekly, every Friday at 11pm. 
# After the script runs, a file should be generated with the date appended to the file name and inside the file should be what was updated.
# Script should run without a user interacting with it. The script should have comments. The script should also have a heading. The script should have limited errors

#!/bin/bash

    #create file 
    touch updatedInfo
    
    #update the server
    echo "Updating the server"
    
     #update the ubuntu server
    sudo apt-get update -y >> updatedInfo
    
    #update the ubuntu server
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y >> updatedInfo
    
    #update the ubuntu server
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y >> updatedInfo
    
    #appended date to the file name and inside the file should be what was updated
